						<h2>Introduction</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Email marketing is an essential tool for driving engagement and conversions, but many campaigns fall short when emails end up in spam folders or links look suspicious. To address these challenges, I developed a <strong>URL Shortener for HTML</strong>, designed specifically to improve link trustworthiness in web email marketing. This tool creates custom, shortened URLs that bypass spam filters, making it easier to connect with customers and increase open and click-through rates.</p>
					
					<header>
						<h2>The Problem</h2>
					</header>
					<p>In email marketing, even well-crafted campaigns can suffer from low engagement if links are flagged by spam filters or if recipients hesitate to click on unfamiliar URLs. Many popular URL shorteners are often blacklisted by spam filters, which can result in emails being marked as spam. Additionally, lengthy or complex URLs can reduce trust and engagement, as they often appear suspicious to recipients. The URL Shortener for HTML helps overcome these issues by creating custom links that maintain trustworthiness and avoid common spam traps.</p>
