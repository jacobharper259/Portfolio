									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>A freelance web developer with a background in customer service</p>
								</header>
								<div class="aboutCon">
									<a class="image featured about"><img src="images/my face.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								</div>
								<p>I am a fullstack freelance web developer in Atlanta. Within my seven years of customer service experience
									I have had the privilege to build connections within my community by organizing projects to help businesses meet their sales goals.
								</p>
								<p>After spending years "inspiring and nurturing the human spirit" at Starbucks, I started
									noticing a trend with the integration of tech-apps into businesses; it felt like they weren't fully considering
									their workers experience before building their apps. This led to confusion from workers to customers, and congestion in
									production channels. So, in my free time, I started learning full-stack web development and reaching 
									out to small businesses in my community, hoping to make positive changes to their customer and worker experience. I spent 6 months
									developing a web application to help starbucks baristas hone their craft and gain proficiency in the POS layout.
								</p>
								<p> After gaining a personally surprising amount of knowledge in frontend and backend Javascript development, I began helping 
									others within the 100DEVS community with all things webdev from explaining how to center a div to giving lectures on MVC and OOP.
